## Indoor Air Quality Assessment of Kitchen Ventilation System Efficiency | Fall 2025

### Abstract

Cooking is a major contributor to poor indoor air quality as particulate matter and pollutants are released into the air (Sun et al., 2023). Ventilation systems are tools to minimize the harmful health effects of inhalation by vacuuming the particles (Sun et al., 2023). Therefore, the following experiment was conducted to determine the efficiency of these systems. Operation of the ventilation system during cooking will result in a lower Indoor Air Quality Index rating (AQI), particulate matter concentrations (PM), and carbon dioxide concentrations compared to cooking with the ventilation system off.

## Analysis of Air Quality in Cedar Rapids, Iowa in 2004(Spring 2025)

### Abstract
Cities around the United States deal with increased levels of air pollution compared to rural areas. Poor outdoor air quality causes major health issues such as respiratory issues, an increased probability of heart attacks, cancer, and more.3 In 1963, the United States established the Clean Air Act to reduce the emissions of air pollutants. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) created the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, or the NAAQS, which were set to regulate criteria pollutants in the air.2 The criteria pollutants include lead, carbon monoxide, particulate matter (PM 2.5 and PM 10), sulfur dioxide, NOx (or “nox”, which includes NO2 and NO), and ozone.

### My engagement

Using MATLAB, I did  analyze the measured maximum concentration of the stated pollutants each day of 2004 in the county of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to extract all criteria pollutants except lead (PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO, and ozone). I used numerical methods to determine the trends across months, the day and value of the highest concentration, and how many times that year the concentration level was higher than the NAAQSs. These comparisons are essential to public health assessments and pattern recognition to mitigate poor air quality with specialized solutions based on what the data says.

    
## Tidal Energy Technology Assessment and Implementation Plans in the Westfjords, Iceland (Summer 2025)

### Abstract
Iceland is a leading country in renewable energy production and prides itself on using the most energy per capita, since they have an abundance of it. The Westfjords are a northwest region that experiences harsh and extreme weather conditions that negatively affect their power infrastructure. The current electrical systems had 14 failures in 2013, which was a slight improvement from the 18 failures in 2009 and 2010 (Naderian et al. 2017). Since this region lacks hot spots for geothermal power and only has one major hydropower plant in Mjólká that has an installed capacity of 10.5 MW, the population relies on the National Grid lines, or the Landsnet, and diesel generators to fulfill demand (Orkubú Vestfjarða, 2025). 

I did a deeper analysis for deploying the tidal energy off the coast of the Westfjords region. Around the world, numerous companies have been attempting to harness renewable energy for decades, yet commercial applications remain scarce. Iceland can become one of the forefronts for tidal, as it did with geothermal, to help other countries learn how durable the technology is in harsher environments. My paper examines what tidal energy technologies are currently being developed for slow-current conditions and their feasibility for implementation in the Westfjords region.

## Air Quality Engineering: Assessment of Kitchen Ventilation System Efficiency

Using MATLAB, I analyzed daily 2004 air quality data from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, focusing on five criteria pollutants—PM₂.₅, SO₂, NO₂, CO, and ozone—to evaluate compliance with the EPA’s National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). I applied spline interpolation (piecewise cubic splines) to model smooth, continuous pollutant concentration curves over time and used numerical optimization (fminbnd) to identify the day and value of maximum concentration for each pollutant. To determine exceedances of NAAQS thresholds, I implemented root-finding methods (fzero) to calculate where pollutant concentrations intersected regulatory limits. These analyses revealed seasonal peaks and temporal patterns in pollutant behavior, providing insight into when and how air quality conditions were most hazardous. The project demonstrates how computational modeling and data-driven pattern recognition can support public health assessments and the design of targeted mitigation strategies for urban air pollution.
