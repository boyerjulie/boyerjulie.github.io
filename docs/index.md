# About me

I am a 3rd-year Environmental Engineering student at Washington University in St. Louis. My interests include renewable energy technology, air quality engineering, and water treatment engineering. I have experience designing theoretical renewable energy plants using computational models and modeling air and water quality data using software. I am seeking Summer 2026 internship opportunities that integrate mathematical modeling and sustainable design to address complex environmental problems.
