    * Ether synthesis 
    * Synthesis of Bromohydrin 

### Environmental Organic Chemistry

* Develop tools to predict unknown properties of these pollutants based on thermodynamics and organic chemistry. Then, we will apply these properties to determine what happens to these pollutants when they are released to the environment

## Transport phenomena

* Articulate the properties that distinguish fluids from other forms of matter, and the broad range of engineering applications which involve fluid mechanics.
* Apply the concepts of vector fields (velocity, force, acceleration), scalar fields (pressure, density, temperature), and vector differential and integral calculus to engineering analysis of fluids systems, and to the interpretation of flow physics through the conservation laws.
* Using Newton’s second law to analysis and design involving fluids at rest using integral and differential calculus, including pressure variation, forces and moments on plane surfaces, and buoyancy.
* Properly apply systems and control volume methods based on mass, momentum, and energy conservation, as appropriate, to the analysis and design of engineering fluids systems.
* Interpret and apply the various differential forms of the conservation laws, particularly Newton’s second law and its various approximate forms, to engineering analysis and design.
* Properly apply mass, momentum, and energy conservation to steady internal (pipe) flows, correctly interpret and apply laminar and turbulent flow models, and estimate head loss and power requirements in piping systems.
* Develop mathematical models through justifiable approximations, correctly interpret and apply the “inviscid” approximation and the “Bernoulli” relationships to analysis of fluid systems, and estimate levels of approximation in engineering models.
* Apply basic principles of dimensional homogeneity to engineering analysis, and apply dimensional analysis and similitude to the representation of data. Properly interpret the Reynolds number and other fundamental nondimensional parameters.
* Apply integral methods and basic empirical and theoretical models to the analysis of boundary layer flows, and to drag on bodies.
