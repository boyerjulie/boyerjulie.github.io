The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) created the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, or the NAAQS, which were set to regulate criteria pollutants in the air.2 The criteria pollutants include lead, carbon monoxide, particulate matter (PM 2.5 and PM 10), sulfur dioxide, NOx (or \u201cnox\u201d, which includes NO2 and NO), and ozone.</p>"},{"location":"projects/#my-engagement","title":"My engagement","text":"<p>Using MATLAB, I did  analyze the measured maximum concentration of the stated pollutants each day of 2004 in the county of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to extract all criteria pollutants except lead (PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO, and ozone).
